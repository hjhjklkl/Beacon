A very little game I made to practice GDevelop

Just a little 2d platformer. Made for practiceing GDevelop and my university assignment.

Use arrow keys to move, Z to jump.

Download from the release tab depending your OS, unzip and run the exe file. Ignore any secure warnings.

There may be many bugs... but at least it is playable.
